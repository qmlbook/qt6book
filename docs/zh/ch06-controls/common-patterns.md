# Common Patterns

There a number of common user interface patterns that can be implemented using Qt Quick Controls. In this section, we try to demonstrate how some of the more common ones can be built.

## Nested Screens

For this example we will create a tree of pages that can be reached from the previous level of screens. The structure is pictured below.

![](./assets/nested-screens.png)

The key component in this type of user interface is the `StackView`. It allows us to place pages on a stack which then can be popped when the user wants to go back. In the example here, we will show how this can be implemented.

The initial home screen of the application is shown in the figure below.

![](./assets/interface-stack-home.png)

The application starts in `main.qml`, where we have an `ApplicationWindow` containing a `ToolBar`, a `Drawer`, a `StackView` and a home page element, `Home`. We will look into each of the components below.



```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    header: ToolBar {

        // ...

    }

    Drawer {

        // ...

    }

    StackView {
        id: stackView
        anchors.fill: parent
        initialItem: Home {}
    }
}
```

The home page, `Home.qml` consists of a `Page`, which is n control element that support headers and footers. In this example we simply center a `Label` with the text *Home Screen* on the page. This works because the contents of a `StackView` automatically fill the stack view, so the page will have the right size for this to work.

<<< @/docs/ch06-controls/src/interface-stack/Home.qml

Returning back to `main.qml`, we now look at the drawer part. This is where the navigation to the pages begin. The active parts of the user interface are the `ÌtemDelegate` items. In the `onClicked` handler, the next page is pushed onto the `stackView`.

As shown in the code below, it possible to push either a `Component` or a reference to a specific QML file. Either way results in a new instance being created and pushed onto the stack.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    Drawer {
        id: drawer
        width: window.width * 0.66
        height: window.height

        Column {
            anchors.fill: parent

            ItemDelegate {
                text: qsTr("Profile")
                width: parent.width
                onClicked: {
                    stackView.push("Profile.qml")
                    drawer.close()
                }
            }
            ItemDelegate {
                text: qsTr("About")
                width: parent.width
                onClicked: {
                    stackView.push(aboutPage)
                    drawer.close()
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // ...

    Component {
        id: aboutPage

        About {}
    }

    // ...

}
```

The other half of the puzzle is the toolbar. The idea is that a back button is shown when the `stackView` contains more than one page, otherwise a menu button is shown. The logic for this can be seen in the `text` property where the `"\\u..."` strings represents the unicode symbols that we need.

In the `onClicked` handler, we can see that when there is more than one page on the stack, the stack is popped, i.e. the top page is removed. If the stack contains only one item, i.e. the home screen, the drawer is opened.

Below the `ToolBar`, there is a `Label`. This element shows the title of each page in the center of the header.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    header: ToolBar {
        contentHeight: toolButton.implicitHeight

        ToolButton {
            id: toolButton
            text: stackView.depth > 1 ? "\u25C0" : "\u2630"
            font.pixelSize: Qt.application.font.pixelSize * 1.6
            onClicked: {
                if (stackView.depth > 1) {
                    stackView.pop()
                } else {
                    drawer.open()
                }
            }
        }

        Label {
            text: stackView.currentItem.title
            anchors.centerIn: parent
        }
    }

    // ...

}
```

Now we’ve seen how to reach the *About* and *Profile* pages, but we also want to make it possible to reach the *Edit Profile* page from the *Profile* page. This is done via the `Button` on the *Profile* page. When the button is clicked, the `EditProfile.qml` file is pushed onto the `StackView`.

![](./assets/interface-stack-profile.png)

<<< @/docs/ch06-controls/src/interface-stack/Profile.qml

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

Page {
    title: qsTr("Profile")

    Column {
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        spacing: 10
        Label {
            anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter
            text: qsTr("Profile")
        }
        Button {
            anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter
            text: qsTr("Edit");
            onClicked: stackView.push("EditProfile.qml")
        }
    }
}
```

## Side by Side Screens

For this example we create a user interface consisting of three pages that the user can shift through. The pages are shown in the diagram below. This could be the interface of a health tracking app, tracking the current state, the user’s statistics and the overall statistics.

![](./assets/side-by-side-screen.png)

The illustration below shows how the *Current* page looks in the application. The main part of the screen is managed by a `SwipeView`, which is what enables the side by side screen interaction pattern. The title and text shown in the figure come from the page inside the `SwipeView`, while the `PageIndicator` (the three dots at the bottom) comes from `main.qml` and sits under the `SwipeView`. The page indicator shows the user which page is currently active, which helps when navigating.

![](./assets/interface-side-by-side-current.png)


Diving into `main.qml`, it consists of an `ApplicationWindow` with the `SwipeView`.

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

ApplicationWindow {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480

    title: qsTr("Side-by-side")

    SwipeView {

        // ...

    }

    // ...

}
```

Inside the `SwipeView` each of the child pages are instantiated in the order they are to appear. They are `Current`, `UserStats` and `TotalStats`.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    SwipeView {
        id: swipeView
        anchors.fill: parent

        Current {
        }

        UserStats {
        }

        TotalStats {
        }
    }

    // ...

}
```

Finally, the `count` and `currentIndex` properties of the `SwipeView` are bound to the `PageIndicator` element. This completes the structure around the pages.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    SwipeView {
        id: swipeView

        // ...

    }

    PageIndicator {
        anchors.bottom: parent.bottom
        anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter

        currentIndex: swipeView.currentIndex
        count: swipeView.count
    }
}
```

Each page consists of a `Page` with a `header` consisting of a `Label` and some contents. For the *Current* and *User Stats* pages the contents consist of a simple `Label`, but for the *Community Stats* page, a back button is included.

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

Page {
    header: Label {
        text: qsTr("Community Stats")
        font.pixelSize: Qt.application.font.pixelSize * 2
        padding: 10
    }

    // ...

}
```

![](./assets/interface-side-by-side-community.png)

The back button explicitly calls the `setCurrentIndex` of the `SwipeView` to set the index to zero, returning the user directly to the *Current* page. During each transition between pages the `SwipeView` provides a transition, so even when explicitly changing the index the user is given a sense of direction.

::: tip
When navigating in a `SwipeView` programatically it is important not to set the `currentIndex` by assignment in JavaScript. This is because doing so will break any QML bindings it overrides. Instead use the methods `setCurrentIndex`, `incrementCurrentIndex`, and `decrementCurrentIndex`. This preserves the QML bindings.
:::

```qml
Page {

    // ...

    Column {
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        spacing: 10
        Label {
            anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter
            text: qsTr("Community statistics")
        }
        Button {
            anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter
            text: qsTr("Back")
            onClicked: swipeView.setCurrentIndex(0);
        }
    }
}
```

## Document Windows

This example shows how to implement a desktop-oriented, document-centric user interface. The idea is to have one window per document. When opening a new document, a new window is opened. To the user, each window is a self contained world with a single document.

![Two document windows and the close warning dialog.](assets/interface-document-window.png)


The code starts from an `ApplicationWindow` with a *File* menu with the standard operations: *New*, *Open*, *Save* and *Save As*. We put this in the `DocumentWindow.qml`.

We import `Qt.labs.platform` for native dialogs, and have made the subsequent changes to the project file and `main.cpp` as described in the section on native dialogs above.

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls
import Qt.labs.platform as NativeDialogs

ApplicationWindow {
    id: root

    // ...

    menuBar: MenuBar {
        Menu {
            title: qsTr("&File")
            MenuItem {
                text: qsTr("&New")
                icon.name: "document-new"
                onTriggered: root.newDocument()
            }
            MenuSeparator {}
            MenuItem {
                text: qsTr("&Open")
                icon.name: "document-open"
                onTriggered: openDocument()
            }
            MenuItem {
                text: qsTr("&Save")
                icon.name: "document-save"
                onTriggered: saveDocument()
            }
            MenuItem {
                text: qsTr("Save &As...")
                icon.name: "document-save-as"
                onTriggered: saveAsDocument()
            }
        }
    }

    // ...

}
```

To bootstrap the program, we create the first `DocumentWindow` instance from `main.qml`, which is the entry point of the application.

<<< @/docs/ch06-controls/src/interface-document-window/main.qml

```qml
import QtQuick

DocumentWindow {
    visible: true
}
```

In the example at the beginning of this chapter, each `MenuItem` calls a corresponding function when triggered. Let’s start with the *New* item, which calls the `newDocument` function.

The function, in turn, relies on the `createNewDocument` function, which dynamically creates a new element instance from the `DocumentWindow.qml` file, i.e. a new `DocumentWindow` instance. The reason for breaking out this part of the new function is that we use it when opening documents as well.

Notice that we do not provide a parent element when creating the new instance using `createObject`. This way, we create new top level elements. If we would have provided the current document as parent to the next, the destruction of the parent window would lead to the destruction of the child windows.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    function createNewDocument()
    {
        var component = Qt.createComponent("DocumentWindow.qml");
        var window = component.createObject();
        return window;
    }

    function newDocument()
    {
        var window = createNewDocument();
        window.show();
    }

    // ...

}
```

Looking at the *Open* item, we see that it calls the `openDocument` function. The function simply opens the `openDialog`, which lets the user pick a file to open. As we don’t have a document format, file extension or anything like that, the dialog has most properties set to their default value. In a real world application, this would be better configured.

In the `onAccepted` handler a new document window is instantiated using the `createNewDocument` method, and a file name is set before the window is shown. In this case, no real loading takes place.

::: tip
We imported the `Qt.labs.platform` module as `NativeDialogs`. This is because it provides a `MenuItem` that clashes with the `MenuItem` provided by the `QtQuick.Controls` module.
:::

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    function openDocument(fileName)
    {
        openDialog.open();
    }

    NativeDialogs.FileDialog {
        id: openDialog
        title: "Open"
        folder: NativeDialogs.StandardPaths.writableLocation(NativeDialogs.StandardPaths.DocumentsLocation)
        onAccepted: {
            var window = root.createNewDocument();
            window.fileName = openDialog.file;
            window.show();
        }
    }

    // ...

}
```

The file name belongs to a pair of properties describing the document: `fileName` and `isDirty`. The `fileName` holds the file name of the document name and `isDirty` is set when the document has unsaved changes. This is used by the save and save as logic, which is shown below.

When trying to save a document without a name, the `saveAsDocument` is invoked. This results in a round-trip over the `saveAsDialog`, which sets a file name and then tries to save again in the `onAccepted` handler.

Notice that the `saveAsDocument` and `saveDocument` functions correspond to the *Save As* and *Save* menu items.

After having saved the document, in the `saveDocument` function, the `tryingToClose` property is checked. This flag is set if the save is the result of the user wanting to save a document when the window is being closed. As a consequence, the window is closed after the save operation has been performed. Again, no actual saving takes place in this example.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    property bool isDirty: true        // Has the document got unsaved changes?
    property string fileName           // The filename of the document
    property bool tryingToClose: false // Is the window trying to close (but needs a file name first)?

    // ...

    function saveAsDocument()
    {
        saveAsDialog.open();
    }

    function saveDocument()
    {
        if (fileName.length === 0)
        {
            root.saveAsDocument();
        }
        else
        {
            // Save document here
            console.log("Saving document")
            root.isDirty = false;

            if (root.tryingToClose)
                root.close();
        }
    }

    NativeDialogs.FileDialog {
        id: saveAsDialog
        title: "Save As"
        folder: NativeDialogs.StandardPaths.writableLocation(NativeDialogs.StandardPaths.DocumentsLocation)
        onAccepted: {
            root.fileName = saveAsDialog.file
            saveDocument();
        }
        onRejected: {
            root.tryingToClose = false;
        }
    }

    // ...

}
```

This leads us to the closing of windows. When a window is being closed, the `onClosing` handler is invoked. Here, the code can choose not to accept the request to close. If the document has unsaved changes, we open the `closeWarningDialog` and reject the request to close.

The `closeWarningDialog` asks the user if the changes should be saved, but the user also has the option to cancel the close operation. The cancelling, handled in `onRejected`, is the easiest case, as we rejected the closing when the dialog was opened.

When the user does not want to save the changes, i.e. in `onNoClicked`, the `isDirty` flag is set to `false` and the window is closed again. This time around, the `onClosing` will accept the closure, as `isDirty` is false.

Finally, when the user wants to save the changes, we set the `tryingToClose` flag to true before calling save. This leads us to the save/save as logic.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    onClosing: {
        if (root.isDirty) {
            closeWarningDialog.open();
            close.accepted = false;
        }
    }

    NativeDialogs.MessageDialog {
        id: closeWarningDialog
        title: "Closing document"
        text: "You have unsaved changed. Do you want to save your changes?"
        buttons: NativeDialogs.MessageDialog.Yes | NativeDialogs.MessageDialog.No | NativeDialogs.MessageDialog.Cancel
        onYesClicked: {
            // Attempt to save the document
            root.tryingToClose = true;
            root.saveDocument();
        }
        onNoClicked: {
            // Close the window
            root.isDirty = false;
            root.close()
        }
        onRejected: {
            // Do nothing, aborting the closing of the window
        }
    }
}
```

The entire flow for the close and save/save as logic is shown below. The system is entered at the *close* state, while the *closed* and *not closed* states are outcomes.

This looks complicated compared to implementing this using `Qt Widgets` and C++. This is because the dialogs are not blocking to QML. This means that we cannot wait for the outcome of a dialog in a `switch` statement. Instead we need to remember the state and continue the operation in the respective `onYesClicked`, `onNoClicked`, `onAccepted`, and `onRejected` handlers.

![](./assets/dialog-state-machine.png)

The final piece of the puzzle is the window title. It is composed from the `fileName` and `isDirty` properties.

```qml
ApplicationWindow {

    // ...

    title: (fileName.length===0?qsTr("Document"):fileName) + (isDirty?"*":"")

    // ...

}
```

This example is far from complete. For instance, the document is never loaded or saved. Another missing piece is handling the case of closing all the windows in one go, i.e. exiting the application. For this function, a singleton maintaining a list of all current `DocumentWindow` instances is needed. However, this would only be another way to trigger the closing of a window, so the logic flow shown here is still valid.
