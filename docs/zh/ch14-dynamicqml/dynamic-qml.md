# Dynamic QML

Until now, we have treated QML as a tool for constructing a static set of scenes and navigating between them. Depending on various states and logic rules, a living and dynamic user interface is constructed. By working with QML and JavaScript in a more dynamic manner, the flexibility and possibilities expand even further. Components can be loaded and instantiated at run-time, elements can be destroyed. Dynamically created user interfaces can be saved to disk and later restored.
