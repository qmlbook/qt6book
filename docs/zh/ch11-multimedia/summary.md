# Summary

The media API provided by Qt provides mechanisms for playing and capturing video and audio. Through the `VideoOutput` element, video streams can be rendered in the user interface. Through the `MediaPlayer` element, most playback can be handled, even though the `SoundEffect` can be used for low-latency sounds. For capturing, or recording camera streams, a combination of `CaptureSession` and `Camera` elements can be used.
