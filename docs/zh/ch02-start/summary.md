# Summary

We have seen how to install the Qt SDK and how to create our first application. Then we walked you through the different application types to give you an overview of Qt, showing off some features Qt offers for application development. I hope you got a good impression that Qt is a very rich user interface toolkit and offers everything an application developer can hope for and more. Still, Qt does not lock you into specific libraries, as you can always use other libraries, or even extend Qt yourself. It is also rich when it comes to supporting different application models: console, classic desktop user interface, and touch user interface.
