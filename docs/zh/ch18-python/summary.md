# Summary

In this chapter we have looked at the PySide6 module from the Qt for Python project. After a brief look at installation, we focused on how Qt concepts are used from Python. This included slots, signals and properties. We also looked at a basic list model and how to expose both Python objects and classes from Python to QML.
