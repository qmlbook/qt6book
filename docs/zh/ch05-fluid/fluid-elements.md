# Fluid Elements

Until now, we have mostly looked at some simple graphical elements and how to arrange and manipulate them. 

This chapter is about how to make these changes more interesting by animating them. 

Animations are one of the key foundations for modern, slick user interfaces, and can be employed in your user interface via states, transitions and animations. Each state defines a set of property changes and can be combined with animations on state changes. These changes are described as a transition from one state to another state.

Besides animations being used during transitions, they can also be used as standalone elements triggered by some scripted events.
