# Quick Starter


This chapter provides an overview of QML, the declarative user interface language used in Qt 6. We will discuss the QML syntax, which is a tree of elements, followed by an overview of the most important basic elements. Later we will briefly look at how to create our own elements, called components and how to transform elements using property manipulations. Towards the end, we will look at how to arrange elements together in a layout and finally have a look at elements where the user can provide input.
