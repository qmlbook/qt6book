# Debugging

Qt Creator is an easy to use and well designed IDE to code your Qt C++ and QML projects. It has world class `CMake` support and is pre-configured for Qt C++ development. Due to its excellent C++ support it can also be used for any other vanilla C++ projects.

::: tip
Hmm, I just realized I have not used debugging a lot. I hope this is a good sign. Need to ask someone to help me out here. In the meantime have a look at the [Qt Creator documentation](http://http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html).
